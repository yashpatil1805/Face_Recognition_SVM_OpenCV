# Face_Recognition_SVM_OpenCV
This project implements real-time face recognition using OpenCV, face_recognition, and an SVM classifier. It trains a recognizer on labeled images in the images/ folder and detects faces in live video streams, labeling them with names. Customizable and easy to extend for personal datasets.
